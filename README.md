# animal-conservation-web-scraper
Mosaic Plot that uses a web scraper and shows conservation status by animal class. 
Cleaned the data and used the compile() function to remove unnecessary html. 
The dataset included more than 200 different animals from five scientific classes. I designed a mosaic plot to provide meaningful insight and only
used a smaller portion of the dataset. It was narrowed down to the largest animal classes represented and the conservation statuses. 
I added the smaller dataset to a dataframe and then shaped the dataframe to work with the mosaic plot. I adjusted the font sizes and colors as well.
